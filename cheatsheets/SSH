Generating a new SSH key

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

Start the ssh-agent in the background.
    $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    > Agent pid 59566

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.
    $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Copy key to server
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey.pub user@host       # -i identity file

Disable SSH root login
    vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config     # set "PermitRootLogin no"
    systemctl restart sshd      # restart ssh deamon

~/.ssh/id_rsa/config
Host foo.bar
 HostName foo.bar
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
