First Usage
1)  To create the docker group and add your user:
        sudo groupadd docker                # Create the docker group.
        sudo usermod -aG docker $USER       # Add your user to the docker group.
        Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

create user docker
    add user docker to group sudo

Best Practice
    Create new user for each container since container user are always root.

Create and link folder to container
    mkdir -p /path/on/host
    chown 1000:1000 /path/on/host
    docker run -v /path/on/host:/data ...




docker ps -a		Shows all container

docker exec -it some-container sh     # Run command inside a container
