# CheatSheets
Simple collection of cheat sheets for use in the shell via aliases.

Does not claim to be complete nor to replace the manual. - Just a collection of commands we have encountered.


## Installation
1. Clone repository
2. Change *$CSPATH* in *.cheatsheets* to your cloned folder location.
3. Link .cheatsheets to your preferred shell.
    for example add
    ```
       source $HOME/<Path>/CheatSheets/.cheatsheets
    ```
    to your .bashrc


## Usage
Use *CSLIST* to show available cheatsheets.
Use them!


## ToDo
- Unified style
- Add other CS's
